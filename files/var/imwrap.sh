# Transport launch wrapper. The transport binary's ELF interpreter is patched to the
# synergy-glibc loader (/media/cryptofs/synergy-glibc/lib/ld-linux.so.3) so purple-signal's
# in-process JVM works (a plain stock/ld-teams.so.3 glibc SIGSEGVs libjvm). Put synergy-glibc/lib
# FIRST so its matching libc/pthread/dl/rt load (loader<->libc are build-coupled). libstdc++
# preloaded first so its operator new wins over libmojocore's weak _Znwj. Self-rotating at 30MB.
#
# synergy-glibc is a specific, frozen glibc 2.23 build (crosstool-NG) -- NOT interchangeable with
# Atlas's own wpe-252 deviceroot, even though both self-report "glibc 2.23": confirmed live that
# swapping in a copy of Atlas's current wpe-252/lib as synergy-glibc SIGSEGVs immediately
# (dmesg: "CRASH! ld-linux.so.3(...) received 11") the moment the kernel tries to use it as the
# transport's ELF interpreter, despite that exact ld-linux.so.3 running fine standalone as an
# ordinary program -- Atlas's build is roughly HALF the size of this one (different build/config
# entirely) and isn't ABI-compatible with the already-built imlibpurpletransport binary. So this
# dir can't be self-provisioned from anything else already on the device; it must be provisioned
# once, manually, per device (see README-device-launch.md) -- most simply by tar'ing it off a
# device that already has a working copy. A device missing it entirely crash-loops the transport
# forever with "env: can't execute ...: No such file or directory" (confirmed live) -- if that
# happens, check for this directory first before assuming anything else is broken.

# NOTHING else (no LS2 calls at all) still produces two fully independent imlibpurpletransport
# processes seconds later, each with its own g_service/g_sa and its own full Teams/Telegram/etc
# login. Whichever one loses a given connector's LSRegisterPalmService call can't receive LS2
# calls for it even though it may have its own valid, separately-logged-in session -- explains a
# night of "REGISTERED but never responds to dial", not any single connector's own code.

# `exec` at the bottom means a shell EXIT trap would never fire anyway (exec replaces the process

# SSLFIX: synergy-glibc/lib ships an OLD libcrypto.so.3 (OpenSSL 3.0.16). Because synergy-glibc must
# be FIRST on LD_LIBRARY_PATH (above), it shadows the newer Atlas OpenSSL in wpe-252/lib, so
# wpe-252's libssl.so.3 (built against 3.3.0+) fails to load ("version OPENSSL_3.3.0 not found").
# libpurple then registers NO ssl provider (purple_ssl_is_supported()==FALSE) and purple-facebook
# -- the ONLY prpl using libpurple's native purple_ssl_* (others bring their own TLS) -- can't do
# HTTPS ("Unable to connect to graph.facebook.com: Cancelled" after a ~30s hang). Fix: prepend a
# dir holding ONLY the matched wpe-252 libcrypto+libssl pair, so OpenSSL loads from there while
# libc/pthread/dl/rt still fall through to synergy-glibc. Self-provisioned from wpe-252 below (a
# re-flash restores it automatically); real copies (not symlinks) so it's self-contained and
# refreshed when the Atlas build changes size.

# SELF-HEAL the PmLog init semaphore before EVERY transport launch. libPmLogLib takes a one-time init

# thread, no log, no accounts ("no messages come in"). This lives in imwrap.sh (not just imdaemon.sh)
# because BOTH launch paths exec here: the upstart resident daemon (imdaemon.sh) AND the on-demand LS2
# .service. Unlinking is harmless -- sem_open recreates a fresh unlocked one; other holders keep theirs.
